Program can be devided into four sections-
	- Heap		:	(Allocated dynamically)
	- Stack		:	(Vairabled in function)
	- Text		:	(Program instruction)
	- Data		:	(Location of vairables)

Data section can be devided into two sections-
	- Initialized		:	(Constant literals)
	- Un-Initialized	:	(.bss	:	Basic Service Set)

Data can have two access-
	- Global	:	(Visiable to other files. eg: gloable variable)
	- Local		:	(Visiable till it's scope. eg- file scope, function scope etc)

Local data have two types-
	- Local to block	:	(static varirable declared in file scope)	
	- Local to file		:	(variables declared in function scope)

Notes:-
=======
	- "nm command" show global data section in upper case and lower case for local.

	- Since static variables are not global that's why "nm command" shows with lower case.

	- Static uninitialized variable goes to .bss(both global and local)
		and with nm command output comes with 'b'.
	
	- Static initialized variables goes to read only(static const), data (non-const)
		and with nm command output comes with 'r'(static const) and 'd'(non-const)

	- Variables local to function/local goes to stack apart from static variables

	- Un-initialized global variables goes to .bss and "nm command" shows with 'B'
	
	- Initialized gloabl variables goes to data section and "nm command" shows with 'D'



Dealing with multiple defined symbols:-
=======================================
Rule 1: 
	- Multiple strong symbols (with same variable name) are not allowed.

Rule 2:-
	- Given a strong symbol and multiple weak symbols, choose the strong symbol.

Rule 3:-
	- Given multiple weak symbols, choose any of the weak symbols.
